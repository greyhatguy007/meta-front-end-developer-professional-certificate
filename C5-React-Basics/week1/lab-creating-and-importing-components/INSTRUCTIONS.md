## Task

You've learned that you can export a component either as a default export or as a named export. You've also learned how to import such components.  

Let's demonstrate this with a basic example. In this exercise, you'll practice saving a component to its own file and importing it into its parent component so that it can be rendered on the screen. 

## Instructions

### **Step 1** 

Move the `Heading` function from App to a separate component file, named "Heading.js".  

Also note that you can build a new file by right-clicking on the `src` folder, then in the right-click contextual menu that appears, clicking on the *New File* command.

After you've clicked the *New File* command, you'll need to type the file name and extension into the slot for the new file. You need to type in: *Heading.js*

Once you've typed *Heading.js*, press the ENTER key to finish the process of naming the file. Upon pressing the ENTER key, your new, empty *Heading.js* file will be shown, ready to be edited and updated with some code.

### **Step 2**

Import the `Heading` component into the `App` component.

### **Step 3**

Remove the sentence that reads: *This is the starting code for “Your first component” ungraded lab* - so that only the `Heading` JSX element remains in the return statement of the App component.

### **Step 4**

Save and view the app in the browser.
