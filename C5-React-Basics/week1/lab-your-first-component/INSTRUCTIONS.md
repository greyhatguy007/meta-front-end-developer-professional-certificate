## Task

You've learned that you can add another component inside the App component, and then render that new component inside the App component's return statement. 
In this exercise, you'll practice doing just that. You will be instructed, step by step, to build a new component inside the App component, and to have it rendered on the screen.
Note: Before you begin, make sure you understand how to work with the Coursera Code Lab for the React Basics course.

## Steps

### **Step 1**

Add a new function to the `App` component, named `Heading`.

* Locate the `src` folder, and inside of it, the `App.js` file. Click on the `App.js` file in the EXPLORER to have it open.
* Now you're ready to add a new function to the `App` component, and name that function `Heading`. Place it at the very top of the `App.js` file.

### **Step 2**

In the body of the `Heading` component, add a `return` statement.

### **Step 3**

To the right of the `return` keyword, add the following JSX code: <h1>This is an h1 heading</h1>

### **Step 4**

Save your changes and view the app in the browser.
