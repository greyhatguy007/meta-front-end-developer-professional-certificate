 ## **Important Note**
The purpose of this Project sandbox is to offer you a space where you can work in VS Code without downloading it to your computer. The Project sandbox already has an empty HTML and CSS file that you can use to develop your home page.

Take note that you can use the Project sandbox multiple times but only for one hour at a time. Make sure you download your files to your computer before the session ends. To work on your project later again, you can simply copy and paste the HTML and CSS code from the downloaded files into the template files provided in the Project Sandbox. Remember to download the edited versions at the end of each session.
